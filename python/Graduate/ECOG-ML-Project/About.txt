For this project I was attempting to reconstruct the audio data from ECOG brain data which
generated from a person's brain perceiving audio and visual stimuli.

A number of different regression approaches were attempted. Functions which generated my submissions
to the Kaggle leaderboard are found in solutions.py while crossvalidation attempts are found
in crossval.py. utils.py contains a number of miscellaneous tools used in the project.
